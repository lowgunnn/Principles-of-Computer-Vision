For this project we worked to implement a number of CV applied tasks including:
 1. Object Extraction.
 2. Image Blending.
 3. Background removing and replacement.
 4. Impainting.
 5. Background Subtraction.
 
As well as implemented 2 metrics:
 * SSD (Sum of Squared Error)
 * MSE (Mean Squared Error)
 
The code is split into two parts Part 1 which covers tasks 1-3 and Part 2 which covers tasks 4-5. 

A brief 4 page report for each task is included in report.pdf. 

For data (image source) we used the [COTS Dataset](#https://github.com/dylanseychell/COTSDataset) as well as a number of images owned by ourselves.
